<h3></h3>Optimal Water Pipeline Network Design for a Residential Society Using Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms</h3>
</b>
Project Description:
In this project, we aim to design a water pipeline network for a residential society, represented as a collection of houses on a 2D plane. Each house is a unique point on this plane, defined by its coordinates. The goal is to construct a water pipeline system that connects all the houses with the minimum possible cost. The cost to lay a pipeline between two houses is based on the Manhattan distance between them, calculated as:
Cost=∣x1−x2∣+∣y1−y2∣
To achieve this, we need to determine the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for the network, which will connect all houses with the least total pipeline cost, ensuring that the water reaches every house without any redundant connections.
Methodology:
We will use two MST algorithms—Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm—to find the optimal pipeline layout. Each algorithm has its unique approach and efficiency characteristics:
1.	Prim's Algorithm: This algorithm constructs the MST by starting from an arbitrary node and expanding the tree by repeatedly adding the nearest vertex not yet in the tree. It is generally well-suited for dense graphs.
2.	Kruskal's Algorithm: This algorithm builds the MST by sorting all edges by their weights and adding edges one by one to the MST, ensuring no cycles form. Kruskal’s algorithm is efficient for sparse graphs and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure for cycle detection.
Objectives:
1.	Calculate MST Using Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms:
o	Implement both algorithms to find the MST of the residential society’s graph.
2.	Compare Efficiency and Cost:
o	Measure and compare the total cost of the pipeline network generated by each algorithm.
o	Compare the execution times of both algorithms to determine which performs better for this problem scenario.
3.	Select Optimal Solution:
o	Based on the comparison, select the MST with the minimum cost and better efficiency to be the final solution for the pipeline layout.
