# Optimal Water Pipeline Network Design for a Residential Society

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing a cost-efficient water pipeline network for a residential society, where each house is represented as a unique point on a 2D plane. The primary objective is to connect all houses with the minimum possible pipeline cost.

The cost of laying a pipeline between two houses is calculated using the **Manhattan Distance** formula:

### **Cost = |x₁ − x₂| + |y₁ − y₂|**

To achieve this, we use Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms to ensure all houses are connected with the least total pipeline cost while avoiding redundant connections.

## Methodology
We employ two well-known MST algorithms to solve this problem:

### 1. **Prim's Algorithm**
- Starts from an arbitrary house and expands the MST by repeatedly adding the nearest unconnected house.
- Works well for dense graphs.

### 2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- Sorts all pipeline costs (edges) and adds them one by one to the MST, ensuring no cycles form.
- Efficient for sparse graphs, using a **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** for cycle detection.

---

## Objectives

### 1. **Calculate MST Using Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms**
- Implement both algorithms to construct the pipeline network.

### 2. **Compare Efficiency and Cost**
- Measure and compare the total pipeline cost generated by each algorithm.
- Evaluate the execution times of both algorithms to determine their efficiency.

### 3. **Select the Optimal Solution**
- Identify the MST with the minimum cost and best performance.
- Use this solution for the final pipeline layout.
